    <h1>Void a Transaction</h1>
    <p>This transaction type can be used to cancel either an original transaction that is not yet settled or an entire order composed of more than one transaction. A Void prevents the transaction or the order from being sent for settlement. A Void can be submitted against any other transaction type.</p>
