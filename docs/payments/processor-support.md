Processor Support
Payment gateways, including Authorize.net, provide an easy way to connect to a merchant's payment processor. While we can simplify certain aspects of the payment process, individual payment processors may respond slightly differently to transaction requests, or may not support the same payment features in the same ways.

Here you may find tables and matrices for specific processor features, and how we support the option.
